# Gaurab Subedi

Hi everyone!

I am Gaurab, a PhD student in Computer Science at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, with a passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Data Science. I specialize in computer vision, natural language processing, and medical imaging applications. Currently, I'm conducting research on Alzheimer's disease biomarker identification and bilingual speech analysis.

I completed my Master of Science in Computer Science from the University of South Dakota with a perfect 4.0 GPA, where I focused on multimodal learning for automated medical report generation. Before pursuing my graduate studies, I worked for three years as an AI Engineer and Data Engineer at Selcouth Technologies Pvt. Ltd (ASMI venture) in Nepal, where I developed deep learning models for fashion detection, recommendation systems, and augmented reality applications.
