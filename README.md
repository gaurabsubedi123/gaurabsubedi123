 Hi everyone!

I am Gaurab and my passion in the field of Artificial Intelligence and Data Science and worked in this field. I have been working with machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and data engineering for the last 2 years. Currently, I am a Graduate Student.

I started my carrer doing internship in computer vision tasks in one of a prestigious fintech company in Nepal called Selcouth Technology Pvt. LTD (ASMI). At ASMI, I mostly tangled with the homography, pattern matching of the surfaces in videoframe including feature point detection in planar surface.

Later I joined there as a Fulltime, where I worked on static clickable poster based projects, 2D poster injection in recorded videos and some research on in-game advertisement After working for two years, I decided to continue my studies and joined the graduate program at University of South Dakota.

For now I am actively looking for a role in data engineering, data analyst and database administrator

## Professional Experience

### CV Engineer and Researcher (Full-time) May 2020 - May 2022

*Selcouth Technologies Pvt. Ltd (ASMI venture)*
- Static Clickable Poster based Projects: Created a system detecting the outfits worn by the people in a recorded video
and suggesting the same outfit from the E-commerce site. Here, I worked with Yolo version4 for training the model also
created 1 millions of datasets of 30 different classes of dresses of male and female and also annotated it with the same model
used for detection.
- 2D poster injection in recorded videos: Basically, it deals with injecting 2D images onto the background of the video.
Most of the part of project uses Opencv. Detecting key points, features, finding the appropriate place for placing the image
in video with the help of feature detection also some research with camera calibration was also made.
- Research on in-game Advertisement: Here the main idea was to place poster (2D image) advertisement in gaming environment. For this we used Unity engine and C# including the ML Library tools present in the unity game engine itself.
